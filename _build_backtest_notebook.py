md(r"""# Does "where should I go?" actually work? — a leakage-free backtest

**Wietze Suijker · IVADO / R7-Environment · Blitz the Gap**

The [north-star doc](../2026-06-11-sota-north-star.md) sets five falsifiable bars for openbiodiversity.ca. Four are proven in the [serving notebook](openbiodiversity-serving-demo.ipynb). The fifth is the hard one:

> **Bar #4 — VOI is *validated*, not asserted.** *"We can show that cells we flagged high-priority on early data actually added species when later sampled. Check: pre/post backtest, reported as a number, not a vibe."*

The serving notebook punted bar #4 as "needs Larocque's private input rasters." **It doesn't.** A sampling-priority map is a *prediction* — "go here, you'll find under-recorded biodiversity" — and a prediction can be backtested on public data alone, with a temporally-disjoint split. This notebook does exactly that, on live iNaturalist project `228908` (the Blitz the Gap umbrella), and reports an honest number.

### The design — leakage-free by construction

```
   observations  ──────────────┬───────────────────────────►  time
   project 228908, BC 2025      │
                                T = 2025-07-01
        ── TRAIN (obs < T) ──►  │  ◄── TEST (obs ≥ T) ──
        compute each cell's     │   measure each cell's
        PRIORITY                │   OUTCOME
        (under-sampling +       │   (# species NEW to that
         staleness)            │    cell, i.e. not seen < T)
```

Priority is computed **only** from pre-T observations; the discovery outcome is measured **only** on post-T observations. No post-T information can leak into the priority. We then ask: **do the cells priority flagged early actually yield more new-to-cell species later?**

### Method, and why these controls (grounded, and adversarially hardened)

iNaturalist effort is famously concentrated and observer-biased ([Di Cecco et al. 2021, *BioScience*](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biab093)), so raw new-species counts mostly track *where people went*. Worse, a per-observation *rate* on revisited cells — the obvious effort control — still leaves a subtler confound: under-sampled cells sit on the **steep part of the species-accumulation curve**, so they look efficient for a partly mechanical reason. Four controls, in increasing strength:

1. **Rate, not count, on revisited cells** — breaks the *volume* bias (Di Cecco 2021).
2. **Permutation null** — shuffle priority across cells (outcome fixed) 2000×; the observed rank-correlation must beat that null. (With 2000 shuffles the smallest reportable p is 1/2000, so "p<0.0005" is the floor — never "p=0".)
3. **Anti-priority baseline** — the same statistic for *density* (where people already sampled heavily) must come out oppositely signed.
4. **Rarefaction to a fixed K test observations per cell** *(the decisive control)* — subsample every cell to exactly K=5 post-T observations and count new-to-cell species. This **equalizes effort**, removing the accumulation-curve confound that control #1 leaves in. If priority still predicts discovery here, the effect is real, not a sampling artifact.

Under-sampling is benchmarked against a per-cell **Chao1** estimate of still-unseen species ([Chao 1984](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615964); [Colwell & Coddington 1994](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1994.0091)). The premise — adaptive/gap-filling sampling beats biased haphazard sampling — is motivated by [Mondain-Monval et al. 2024, *MEE*](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14355) (a virtual-ecologist *simulation*, so this backtest is a **novel composite** on real temporal data, not a replication).

> **Honest scope & disclosed caveats.** Retrospective simulation over *collected* observations, not prospective field guidance. "New species" = new to that cell's iNat record, not new-to-science. The 2025 BC pilot data make the split lopsided — **train is effectively June-only** (the pilot started June 1), test is Jul–Sep. The priority signal is **scarcity-dominated**; the staleness component carries weaker independent signal. Part of the scarcity effect is definitional (under-recorded cells have more left to find) — but it is validated *out-of-sample* and *survives effort-equalization* (control #4). This validates the live-feed *priority mechanism* (serving notebook §7), a 2-dim proxy of the BCParks 5-dim score — not the full engine.""")

- **Does not:** validate the full BCParks 5-dimensional score (this is the 2-dim proxy); guide *prospective* field sampling (it is retrospective over collected obs); escape iNat observer bias entirely (controlled, not removed). "New species" is new-to-cell-record, not new-to-science.
