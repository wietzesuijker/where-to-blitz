# Where to Blitz the Gap — a walkthrough

*What is in the tool, and why is it built the way it is.*

[Where to Blitz the Gap](https://wietzesuijker.github.io/where-to-blitz/) is a companion
planning tool for the Canada-wide [Blitz the Gap](https://blitzthegap.org) iNaturalist
bioblitz. It turns one question — *"where should I go to record biodiversity so my
observation adds the most to what we know about Canada?"* — into a map you can weight,
explore, and plan a real low-carbon trip on.

If you build, score, or run the campaign — this is the methodology and the data underneath it,
laid out so you can check every choice and reproduce every number.

> It is a **work-in-progress prototype, not an official Blitz the Gap tool, and not ground truth.**
> It is a *planning aid*. The responsible-use guardrails are part of the design, not an afterthought (last section).

This walkthrough is **not** about the modelling pipeline in the abstract. The moat is the
**set of choices** that make the map trustworthy and the **contents** those choices produce.
Each section pairs a design decision with the real data it acts on. Everything below runs
from the committed build — re-execute top to bottom to reproduce every figure.

| `build_fullgrid_ca.py` | The four raster axes per cell — **discover, env (climate surprisal), urgency, travel** — plus `n_train`. Defines the grid + land mask. |
| `build_atrisk_layer.py` + `join_conservation.py` | The **conservation** axis: CAN-SAR (COSEWIC/SARA) species × their GBIF occurrences → per-cell status-weighted at-risk richness, aggregated to 25 km. |
| cluster DuckDB → `ca_inat_metrics.csv` → `build_staleness_layer.py` | The **staleness** axis: all-time vs last-5-years iNaturalist density per cell. |
| `build_webapp.py` | The single source of truth for the app. Combines the five axes into **impact** (a percentile rank), holds every UI string (EN/FR), the trip planner, and emits `index.html`. |
| `build_provenance.py` | Freezes the national build to a hashed manifest (`provenance.json`). |
| `voi_backtest.py`, `backtest_appscore.py` | The validation layer: do directed (gap-filling) priorities actually discover more than going where it's already busy? |

The rest of the notebook walks the **GRID → APP** path: the contents of a cell, the choice
behind each axis, the choice behind the composite, and finally the evidence that the central
choice is the right one.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the data
md(r"""
## 2 · The data

Six public sources, each chosen because it is **fetchable without credentials** and
**national in coverage** — a hard constraint, because the tool must be reproducible by
anyone and must not depend on the private McGill iNat-Canada parquet.

| Axis | Source | What it is | Resolution | Licence / access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| discover | iNaturalist observation density (Biodiversité Québec STAC) | per-group "light up the map" record density — the same surface the official project uses | 1 km COG | public COG on Arbutus |
| conservation | **CAN-SAR** (COSEWIC/SARA) × **GBIF** | 521 at-risk species × their Canadian occurrences | point → 25 km | CC-BY (OSF `10.17605/OSF.IO/E4A58`) + public GBIF |
| env | **CHELSA** bioclimate | temperature, seasonality, precipitation | ~1 km | public (`/vsicurl`) |
| staleness | **iNaturalist open-data** dump | per-record dates → all-time vs recent | per-record | public AWS dump |
| urgency | **Hansen** Global Forest Change | forest-loss fraction (logging / fire / dieback) | 0.05° | public |
| travel | **Weiss et al. 2018** accessibility | minutes to the nearest city | ~1 km | public (MalariaAtlas) |

A subtle but load-bearing data choice: the **land mask** is the Weiss travel raster's
ocean=nodata, intersected with Natural Earth coastlines *and* the iNat density COG footprint.
That last intersection dropped ~839 deep-US no-data cells that would otherwise have shown as
false gaps. The grid is a *decision*, not a given.
""")

# ---- why US
md(r"""
### 2.1 · Why the map spills into the United States

One thing you notice immediately: there is real data across Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana,
the Dakotas, Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine. That is **not a bug, but it is a known
consequence of two deliberate choices**, worth being explicit about:

1. **The grid is a rectangle whose southern edge is 41°N**, chosen to capture Canada's
   *southernmost* biodiversity hotspots — Point Pelee (41.9°N), the Carolinian zone, southern
   Vancouver Island. A latitude line at 41°N necessarily scoops up a band of the northern US.
2. **The land mask is *geographic*, not *political*.** `build_fullgrid_ca.py` keeps a cell if
   the Weiss travel-time raster says it's land (ocean = nodata) — it does **not** clip to the
   Canada polygon. The Natural Earth refinement only removed ocean and Greenland, keeping
   Canada **and** US land.

The important honesty point is *what the US data is and isn't*: the density layer is the
**Canada-focused** `inat_canada_heatmaps` COG. Its footprint spills a little across the border,
but the overwhelming majority of US cells sit **outside** the Canadian recording layer — so
they read as "gaps" largely because *the Canadian density layer stops at the border*, not
because they are genuinely under-recorded. (The team already dropped 839 *deep*-US cells that
were entirely outside the COG.) The figure quantifies it.

**Measures:** how under-sampled a cell is. **Formula intent:** lower iNaturalist density →
higher discover.

**The choice.** The obvious formula is `norm(1 / (density + ε))`. We *don't* ship it. On the
real national density it is violently bimodal: ~half the cells have zero research-grade
records and pin at 1.0, while every recorded cell collapses to near-zero — the map becomes a
binary "recorded / not", with no gradient to plan a trip on. The shipped axis is instead a
**smooth under-sampling rank**, with zero-observation ties broken by climate distinctiveness
(`env`). The figure shows why the rank is the better content.

### 3.2 · Find rare species — and the **dual-use safety choice**

**Measures:** how many of Canada's at-risk species occur in a cell — "Canada's Most Wanted."
**Formula:** per cell, sum status weights of at-risk species recorded there
(**Endangered 3 · Threatened 2 · Special Concern 1**), then min–max to 0–1.

**The choice that defines this axis is what we *refuse* to expose.** Pollock et al. 2025
(*Nat Rev Biodiversity*, Box 3) warns that fine-grained "where do threatened species occur"
maps can aid poaching and collection. So the underlying CAN-SAR × GBIF point occurrences are
**aggregated away** in `join_conservation.py`; only a per-cell *sum of status weights over a
25 km cell* ever reaches the public app. It says "this region is rich in at-risk species,"
never which species or where within the cell. Coarse binning + all-taxa pooling are the
mitigation, and they stay in force for any future finer layer.

### 3.3 · Cover every habitat — climate surprisal

**Measures:** how under-sampled a cell's *climate type* is (not its location).
**Formula:** in 3-D CHELSA climate space (temperature, seasonality, precipitation), estimate
how densely *recorded* places resemble this cell's climate via a density-weighted Gaussian
kernel; `env = −log(weighted climate density)`, percentile-ranked 0–1.

**The choice:** geographic gap ≠ environmental gap. A cell can be near a city yet sit in a
climate type almost nobody records. Scoring "climate surprisal" rather than distance keeps the
axis genuinely distinct from `discover` (we verify that distinctness in Section 6).

### 3.4 · Freshest gaps — and the **iNat-only data-integrity choice**

**Measures:** cells well-recorded *historically* on iNaturalist but *quiet recently* — worth
revisiting. **Formula:** for cells with ≥20 historical records,
`staleness = (1 − n_recent/n_all) · log(1 + n_all)`, min–max 0–1.

**The choice, caught by cross-validation.** An earlier version sourced this from GBIF density.
But GBIF blends iNaturalist + eBird + museum specimens — eBird's recent bird volume and museums'
old specimens distort "where *iNaturalist users* have gone quiet." A cluster cross-validation
against the raw iNat dump found the GBIF signal was null (ρ ≈ −0.065) and the axis was
**re-sourced to iNaturalist-only**. This is the discipline the project runs on: an
un-validated layer is not trusted into the map.

## 4 · The composite "impact" — the **percentile-rank choice**

You set a weight 0–1 per axis; per cell `raw_impact = Σ wᵢ · axisᵢ`. The number shown is
**not** that raw value — it's its **percentile rank** across the cells in view.

**Why this is the most important single choice in the app.** A handful of Arctic
"super-gaps" (max discover *and* rare climate) have enormous raw impact. Under a min–max
scale they stretch the colour ramp so every reachable southern cell collapses to ~0/100 —
the map tells a planner "nowhere near you matters," which is both false and useless. A
percentile rank spends the whole 0–100 range on the cells actually in view. The figure shows

If the five axes were near-duplicates, the sliders would be theatre. They aren't. Below is
the Spearman rank-correlation between axes **computed over recorded cells only** (`n_train > 0`).

> A verification catch worth flagging: computed over the *full* grid, discover and env

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- trip planner
md(r"""
## 7 · From map to trip — the planning choices

The map answers *where*; the planner answers *where can I actually get to and back, greenest*.
The choices here are about **cost and carbon, never about boosting the score**:

- **Accessibility is a cost denominator, not a booster.** Trips rank by `impact × field-time`,
  and travel time only ever *divides* — so the planner never re-creates roadside sampling bias
  by rewarding easy-to-reach cells. Remote gaps stay high-priority; they just cost more to reach.
- **Adaptive greenest mode.** The default travel mode is the greenest (Walk > Cycle > Drive)
  that can still reach a gap within your time budget — chosen from your start, not assumed.
- **Real routes, honest fallback.** Walk/Cycle/Drive routes come from OSRM; when a route can't
  be fetched it falls back to a straight-line estimate (×1.35 road factor) and the trip is
  *flagged as estimated*. Driving ≈ 0.18 kg CO₂/km; cycling/walking zero.
- **"Worth the drive."** A field:travel ratio floor (record ≥ half the time you drive) keeps the
  default trip from being 4 h of driving for 1 h of recording.

There is no figure here because this is interaction, not data — but it is the same discipline:
every default is a defensible choice, and the estimated cases are labelled as such.

## 8 · Does the central choice hold up? — directed beats opportunistic

The app's core bet is that **directing people to under-sampled cells discovers more new
species than letting them go where it's already busy.** That is a *prediction*, and it is
backtestable on public data alone — no need for the private parquet.

**Design of the test** (`backtest_appscore.py`, leakage-free): take the 2025 BC pilot
(iNat project 228908), split each cell's records at a date `T`. Build the priority axes from
**train-only** observations; score the outcome as **new-to-cell species** from **test-only**
observations. To kill the species-accumulation confound, rarefy every cell to a fixed `K = 5`
test observations. A positive Spearman ρ between an axis and post-split discovery means that
axis sends you to genuinely productive cells.

**Two honest findings to highlight:**

1. **The signal is real but lives almost entirely in the under-sampling axis.** `discover` on
   its own matches or beats the full default preset; `env` and `urgency` are ~uncorrelated with
   *this* discovery objective (they optimise *other* goals by design). So the default
   `0.8·discover + 0.7·env + 0.3·urgency` slightly **dilutes** discovery — re-tuning the default
   toward discover is an open product decision, surfaced not silently "fixed."
2. **It replicates out of region.** Re-running on a disjoint Eastern-Canada window (ON/QC/
   Maritimes) reproduces the directed > opportunistic result — it is not a BC artifact.

md(r"""
## 9 · Responsible use — guardrails as design, not disclaimer

These constraints shaped the contents above; they are the reason some things are *coarse* or
*absent* on purpose:

- **Species-at-risk are gated out of suggestions.** Every live iNaturalist fetch carries
  `taxon_geoprivacy=open` and the "fill the gap" suggestions add `threatened=false`. The tool
  will not point a stranger at a rare orchid.
- **The conservation axis is coarse by design** (Section 3.2) — a 25 km, all-taxa sum, never
  a species map. Dual-use mitigation (Pollock et al. 2025, Box 3) stays in force for any
  finer future layer.
- **Indigenous data sovereignty.** Obscure sensitive locations and respect
  [Indigenous data sovereignty](https://native-land.ca) before any public use; a territory
  acknowledgment is linked in-app.
- **It is a prototype, flagged in-app**, and a *planning aid, not a census*. iNaturalist counts
  are sampling effort, not ground-truth abundance, and are labelled that way throughout.
