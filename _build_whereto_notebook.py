**Blitz the Gap · openbiodiversity.ca**

A "where should I go?" map looks like one map, but it hides a question: *what are you trying to achieve?* Find as many species as possible? Find the rare ones that matter for conservation? Cover habitats nobody has sampled? Reach places before they're logged or developed? These goals point to **different places** — so one map cannot serve them all.

This notebook treats the map as an **explicit, switchable choice of objective**, on real British Columbia observations from iNaturalist. Pick a goal, and the map re-ranks where to go. The recipe for every cell on the map is:

```
priority(cell)  =   value(cell, chosen objective)
                  ─────────────────────────────────   ×  guardrail
                      ( 1 + hours of travel )
```

Five objectives are offered — **discover, conservation, climate-coverage, staleness, urgency** (each explained in the next section). Travel time enters only as a *cost you divide by*, never as a reason to pick a place. A guardrail step protects sensitive species and respects data-sovereignty rules.

To check that each objective really delivers on its goal, the observations are split in time: earlier ones build the map, later ones (held back) test it. A goal "works" only if the places it picked from the early data actually paid off in the later data.

> What this map is for: directing where people **record which species live where**. It does not tell you how *many* individuals are present, what their traits are, or how species interact — those need different kinds of fieldwork. And it is tested on observations already collected, which is a realistic dry run, not a live field trial.""")

md(r"""## How each piece is computed

Everything sits on a grid of ~25 km cells over British Columbia. The observations are split by date: earlier ones define every score, later ones (held back) test it. Because the scores never see the later data, the test is honest. Each objective is a number from 0 to 1 on every cell, and they answer different questions:

- **discover — "go where few people have looked."** A cell's score is simply `1 / (number of earlier observations there)`: the emptier the cell, the higher the score. It is the simplest idea, and a good one for turning up new species.

- **conservation — "go where rare species already are."** First, each species gets a rarity weight — a species recorded in only a few places counts for a lot, one found everywhere counts for little. A cell's score is the *average rarity of the species already seen there*. The reasoning: rare species cluster in particular places, so a cell that already shows rare species is where more of them are likely to be found.

- **climate-coverage — "go where the *climate* is under-sampled, wherever that is."** This one is subtle. Two cells hundreds of km apart can have the *same* climate — recording the second adds little, because that kind of place is already covered. Meanwhile a rare habitat tucked inside a busy region is a real gap an "empty cells" map misses. So instead of empty *map* space, this looks at empty *climate* space:
  1. For each cell, read three climate values — average temperature, how much temperature swings across the year, and annual rainfall.
  2. Place each cell in this 3-D "climate space."
  3. Measure how crowded each cell's climate already is with existing records (a smooth count of nearby records in climate space).
  4. Score = `1 / crowding`. A cell whose climate is *rare* among existing records scores high — even if it sits in a busy area — and a remote cell with an *ordinary* climate scores low.
  That is why it picks very different places from *discover* (see §1). Its goal is covering the full range of habitats, not finding the most species — so the species-count test further down does not measure it, and shouldn't.

- **staleness — "go where no one has been lately."** Days since the most recent observation in the cell. Keeps the map current.

- **urgency — "sample before it changes."** How much of the cell has lost forest cover recently (from a global forest-loss map, 2015 onward). Places being rapidly cleared are a last chance to record what lives there. Like climate-coverage, this is a forward-looking goal, so the backward-looking species test doesn't capture it.

**Cost and guardrail.** Travel time to the nearest town (a published global map) is the cost: the final priority is `value / (1 + travel-hours)`, so a far-off but valuable cell stays in the running only until the trip becomes too expensive. On top of that, a guardrail hides the locations of sensitive species and respects Indigenous data-sovereignty rules.

**How each goal is tested.** On the held-back later observations, every cell is trimmed to the same small number of visits (five) so a cell can't look good just because it was visited more. Then, per cell, we count how many species turned up that were *new to that cell*, the same count weighted by rarity, and the *average rarity* of those new species. A goal "works" if the cells it ranked high really did deliver more of its target. To be sure a result isn't luck, the scores are reshuffled thousands of times; `*` marks a result that beats that chance baseline.""")

*Climate-coverage* and *urgency* score near zero here, and that is **correct, not a failure**. Their goals are not "find the most species": climate-coverage is about sampling every kind of habitat, and urgency is about reaching places before they change — neither is what this species-count test measures.

md(r"""## 5 · What this shows

A "where should I go?" map is really a **choice of goal**, not a single right answer. The five goals send you to genuinely different places (§1, §2), and — the key point — each one delivers on its *own* aim when checked against held-back data (§3): chasing numbers finds many but common species; explicitly asking for rare species finds them; covering habitats and catching change-prone places are separate aims again.

The practical takeaway: a good tool should let people pick the goal openly, and should *prove* each goal works rather than assume it. Adding a new goal means adding one score and running the same held-out test.

**What it does and doesn't do.** It guides where to *record which species live where* — not how many individuals are present, what their traits are, or how species interact, which need other kinds of fieldwork. Travel time only ever *lowers* a place's priority (a cost), never raises it. Sensitive-species locations are hidden and Indigenous data-sovereignty rules respected. The check uses observations already collected — a realistic dry run, not a live field season.""")
