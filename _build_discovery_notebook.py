md(r"""# When does an embedding beat geographic coverage for species discovery? It scales with species richness

**A multi-backbone, multi-taxon experiment on real Blitz the Gap / iNaturalist data over Canada.**

This tests the central, honest claim of [design-04](../2026-06-11-design-04-discovery-acquisition.md): is a fancier
acquisition function — pick the observation whose *vision embedding* is most novel — actually better than a simple
one — pick the observation farthest away in *geographic space*? The literature says geographic coverage is hard to
beat (Sener & Savarese 2018, CoreSet; Rauch 2025, *No Free Lunch in Active Learning*), so the answer is expected to
be conditional, not a blanket yes.

**The headline, stated up front and checked below (across eight taxa, 36 → 518 species):**
1. **Embedding-acquisition benefit rises with species richness** (Spearman ρ = +0.79 over the eight taxa). It is
   ~zero or negative for species-poor taxa (Amphibia 36, Reptilia 53) and very large for species-rich ones
   (Aves 246, Insecta 392, Fungi 317, Plantae 518). The natural mechanism guess — "it's gated by how well the
   backbone embeds the taxon" — was **tested and not supported**: per-taxon kNN separability does *not* predict the
   benefit (ρ = −0.07, confounded with richness), and the one negative outlier, **Arachnida (160 spp)**, is *not*
   the worst-embedded taxon (Insecta has lower separability yet a large positive benefit). Richness is the
   predictor; the Arachnida exception is real but **unexplained** (its spatial signal is unusually strong — the
   largest haversine-over-raw gap of any taxon — which may crowd out the embedding).
2. **A combined spatial+embedding objective beats the best spatial baseline for 7 of 8 taxa** — a good default for a
   multi-taxon planner, but not unconditional (it fails on Arachnida).
3. **The best geographic distance metric is taxon-dependent, not universal.** Raw lat/lon (which over-weights
   longitude) out-discovers great-circle distance for amphibians, but great-circle wins for most other taxa — so
   "weight longitude" is an amphibian quirk, *not* a general law. (An earlier amphibian-only read of this
   experiment over-generalised that quirk; the multi-taxon run below corrects it.)

**Method.** Pull research-grade amphibian observations (photo + species label + coords) from project 228908 over
Canada. Extract vision embeddings, then simulate active species discovery from a random seed and measure the
**species-discovery curve** (cumulative distinct species vs. observations sampled), averaged over many seeds. The
discovery curve is the coupon-collector process under unequal abundances (Zoroa et al. 2017).

**Six acquisition strategies** — built so the comparison is *fair in both directions*: the embedding gets its best
shot (robust coverage, not just an outlier-prone one), and the geographic baseline is tested under two distance
metrics so a "coverage wins" verdict can't hide behind a lucky metric choice.

| strategy | rule |
|---|---|
| `random` | uniform sampling — the floor |
| `spatial_coverage` | greedy k-center in geographic space, **great-circle (haversine) distance** |
| `spatial_coverage_raw` | greedy k-center using **raw lat/lon Euclidean** (degrees) — the "wrong" metric, kept as a control |
| `embedding_novelty` | greedy k-center in embedding space (= CoreSet; maximises min-distance, outlier-prone) |
| `embedding_kmeanspp` | D²-weighted probabilistic coverage in embedding space (robust to photo outliers) |
| `combined` | z-scored geographic + embedding min-distance (the multi-axis "app" objective) |

To check the result isn't an artifact of one embedding, we re-run with **backbones of decreasing quality**:
DINOv2 (self-supervised ViT) → CLIP (language-aligned ViT) → ResNet50 (supervised ImageNet).

**The verdict is a paired test, not eyeballed.** For a given seed every strategy starts from the same random
observation, so each seed's `species@budget` values are *paired* across strategies. We report the paired mean
difference, a 95% bootstrap CI, and a two-sided sign-flip permutation p-value (plus a Wilcoxon cross-check) — all
computed on the cluster and stored in the result JSON.

**Verified literature grounding** (every citation checked to exist):
- Sener & Savarese (2018), *Active Learning for CNNs: A Core-Set Approach*, ICLR, arXiv:1708.00489 — coverage/k-center is the strong baseline.
- Rauch et al. (2025), *No Free Lunch in Active Learning…*, arXiv:2506.01992 — which strategy wins depends on embedding quality.

Reading the amphibian deep-dive (above) together with the cross-taxon generalization (table below):

1. **Embedding-acquisition benefit rises with species richness** (Spearman ρ = +0.79 across eight taxa). It climbs
   from ~zero/negative at low richness (Amphibia 36 spp, Reptilia 53 spp) to very large at high richness (Aves 246:
   +9.69; Insecta 392: +13.07; Plantae 518: +48.67; Fungi 317: +53.73 sp). **A "gated by embedding quality" second
   axis was hypothesised and refuted** (separability cell below): per-taxon kNN separability doesn't predict benefit
   (ρ = −0.07) and Arachnida (the lone negative outlier, 160 spp) is not even the worst-embedded taxon. So the clean
   driver is richness; the Arachnida exception is real but **mechanistically open**.

2. **A combined spatial+embedding objective beats the best spatial baseline for 7 of 8 taxa** — a good default, not
   an unconditional one. It wins everywhere except Arachnida (−5.75). "Combine the two axes" is a strong heuristic
   with one known failure on this data.

3. **The best geographic distance metric is taxon-dependent — there is no universal "weight longitude."** Raw
   lat/lon out-discovers great-circle for amphibians (+1.31) but great-circle wins for most other taxa. An earlier
   amphibian-only read of this experiment promoted the longitude-overweighting quirk to a headline; the multi-taxon
   run **retracts** that generalization — it is amphibian-specific.

4. **For amphibians specifically (the BTG worked example), backbone quality gates the combined win.** Combined
   beats the best spatial baseline on DINOv2 but not on CLIP/ResNet50 — exactly No-Free-Lunch (Rauch 2025). And
   k-center (CoreSet) is outlier-prone: robust D²-coverage (`kmeans++`) rescues the weak ResNet50 backbone.

**What this does NOT claim:** it's a retrospective simulation over already-collected observations (not prospective
field sampling), n is bounded (1200 obs/taxon, budget 300), the embeddings are off-the-shelf, and the generalization
taxa use a Canada-bbox pull (no project filter) so the sampling universe differs slightly from the amphibian
(project-228908) run — the *within-taxon* contrasts are unaffected. Claims are scoped to "which acquisition order
rediscovers known species fastest on this sample."

## Does it generalize beyond amphibians? Across eight taxa (36 → 518 species)

The experiment was repeated on richer Canada-wide taxa (DINOv2, iNat research-grade, project-free bbox):

- **Metric lever flips.** `haversine − raw` is *negative* for amphibians (raw wins) but mostly *positive* for the
  other taxa (great-circle wins). Longitude-overweighting is amphibian-specific, not a law.
- **Embedding benefit rises with richness** (ρ = +0.79). `bestEmb − bestSpatial` climbs from negative at low
  richness to very large at high richness — **except Arachnida (160 spp), strongly negative**. The "it's gated by
  embedding quality" guess is tested and refuted in the separability cell below.
- **Combined wins for 7 of 8 taxa.** `combined − bestSpatial` is positive everywhere except Arachnida.""")
