md(r"""# When does an embedding beat geographic coverage for species discovery? When it matches the domain

**A multi-backbone, multi-taxon experiment on real Blitz the Gap / iNaturalist data over Canada.**

This tests the central, honest claim of [design-04](../2026-06-11-design-04-discovery-acquisition.md): is a fancier
acquisition function — pick the observation whose *vision embedding* is most novel — actually better than a simple
one — pick the observation farthest away in *geographic space*? The literature says geographic coverage is hard to
beat (Sener & Savarese 2018, CoreSet; Rauch 2025, *No Free Lunch in Active Learning*), so the answer is expected to
be conditional, not a blanket yes.

**The headline, stated up front and checked below (eight taxa, 36 → 536 species, four backbones):**
1. **Embedding *domain-match* is decisive — this is the No-Free-Lunch result.** A **domain-specific embedding
   (BioCLIP**, trained on the TreeOfLife species images) beats the best geographic baseline on **all 8 taxa**
   (Spearman ρ = +0.91). Generic embeddings beat it on only a subset, and the count scales with quality/domain-fit:
   **BioCLIP 8/8 → DINOv2 5/8 → CLIP 4/8 → ResNet50 3/7.**
2. **This resolves the Arachnida anomaly.** Generic embeddings *fail* on spiders (DINOv2 −1.67/best spatial) — the
   exception no separability metric could explain — but **BioCLIP gives +19.78**. The mechanism was domain-mismatch
   (web/ImageNet backbones embed arthropods poorly), not anything intrinsic to the taxon. Generic-embedding
   separability missed it because it doesn't measure domain fit.
3. **With generic embeddings, benefit rises with species richness** (ρ = +0.79 DINOv2 / +0.55 CLIP / +0.61 ResNet50)
   and the richness *threshold* to help rises as the embedding weakens — now understood as a symptom of weak
   domain-match, which a domain-specific embedding lifts away.
4. **The best geographic distance metric is taxon-dependent** (raw lat/lon out-discovers great-circle for amphibians
   only) and a **combined spatial+embedding** objective is a good default. (An earlier amphibian-only read
   over-generalised the longitude quirk; the multi-taxon run corrects it.)
5. **Actionable for BTG:** the discover/where-to-go axis should use a **domain-specific (BioCLIP-class) embedding** —
   it dominates geographic coverage across every taxon tested, including the ones where generic embeddings fail.
2. **A combined spatial+embedding objective beats the best spatial baseline for 7 of 8 taxa** — a good default for a
   multi-taxon planner, but not unconditional (it fails on Arachnida).
3. **The best geographic distance metric is taxon-dependent, not universal.** Raw lat/lon (which over-weights
   longitude) out-discovers great-circle distance for amphibians, but great-circle wins for most other taxa — so
   "weight longitude" is an amphibian quirk, *not* a general law. (An earlier amphibian-only read of this
   experiment over-generalised that quirk; the multi-taxon run below corrects it.)

**Method.** Pull research-grade amphibian observations (photo + species label + coords) from project 228908 over
Canada. Extract vision embeddings, then simulate active species discovery from a random seed and measure the
**species-discovery curve** (cumulative distinct species vs. observations sampled), averaged over many seeds. The
discovery curve is the coupon-collector process under unequal abundances (Zoroa et al. 2017).

**Six acquisition strategies** — built so the comparison is *fair in both directions*: the embedding gets its best
shot (robust coverage, not just an outlier-prone one), and the geographic baseline is tested under two distance
metrics so a "coverage wins" verdict can't hide behind a lucky metric choice.

| strategy | rule |
|---|---|
| `random` | uniform sampling — the floor |
| `spatial_coverage` | greedy k-center in geographic space, **great-circle (haversine) distance** |
| `spatial_coverage_raw` | greedy k-center using **raw lat/lon Euclidean** (degrees) — the "wrong" metric, kept as a control |
| `embedding_novelty` | greedy k-center in embedding space (= CoreSet; maximises min-distance, outlier-prone) |
| `embedding_kmeanspp` | D²-weighted probabilistic coverage in embedding space (robust to photo outliers) |
| `combined` | z-scored geographic + embedding min-distance (the multi-axis "app" objective) |

To check the result isn't an artifact of one embedding, we re-run with **backbones of decreasing quality**:
DINOv2 (self-supervised ViT) → CLIP (language-aligned ViT) → ResNet50 (supervised ImageNet).

**The verdict is a paired test, not eyeballed.** For a given seed every strategy starts from the same random
observation, so each seed's `species@budget` values are *paired* across strategies. We report the paired mean
difference, a 95% bootstrap CI, and a two-sided sign-flip permutation p-value (plus a Wilcoxon cross-check) — all
computed on the cluster and stored in the result JSON.

md(r"""## Verdict — honest, and actionable for Blitz the Gap

Reading the amphibian deep-dive (above) together with the cross-taxon generalization (table below):

1. **Embedding *domain-match* decides whether the embedding helps (No Free Lunch).** A domain-specific embedding
   (BioCLIP) beats the best geographic baseline on **all 8 taxa** (ρ = +0.91); generic embeddings win on a
   quality-ordered subset (DINOv2 5/8 → CLIP 4/8 → ResNet50 3/7). With generic embeddings the benefit rises with
   richness and the threshold tracks backbone quality — a symptom of weak domain-match that BioCLIP removes.

2. **The Arachnida anomaly is resolved by domain-match.** Generic embeddings are negative on spiders (DINOv2
   −1.67) — an exception that *no* separability metric explained — but BioCLIP gives **+19.78**. The cause was
   domain-mismatch (web/ImageNet backbones embed arthropods poorly), confirmed by the fix, not anything intrinsic.

2. **A combined spatial+embedding objective beats the best spatial baseline for 7 of 8 taxa** — a good default, not
   an unconditional one. It wins everywhere except Arachnida (−5.75). "Combine the two axes" is a strong heuristic
   with one known failure on this data.

3. **The best geographic distance metric is taxon-dependent — there is no universal "weight longitude."** Raw
   lat/lon out-discovers great-circle for amphibians (+1.31) but great-circle wins for most other taxa. An earlier
   amphibian-only read of this experiment promoted the longitude-overweighting quirk to a headline; the multi-taxon
   run **retracts** that generalization — it is amphibian-specific.

4. **For amphibians specifically (the BTG worked example), backbone quality gates the combined win.** Combined
   beats the best spatial baseline on DINOv2 but not on CLIP/ResNet50 — exactly No-Free-Lunch (Rauch 2025). And
   k-center (CoreSet) is outlier-prone: robust D²-coverage (`kmeans++`) rescues the weak ResNet50 backbone.

**What this does NOT claim:** it's a retrospective simulation over already-collected observations (not prospective
field sampling), n is bounded (1200 obs/taxon, budget 300), the embeddings are off-the-shelf, and the generalization
taxa use a Canada-bbox pull (no project filter) so the sampling universe differs slightly from the amphibian
(project-228908) run — the *within-taxon* contrasts are unaffected. Claims are scoped to "which acquisition order
rediscovers known species fastest on this sample."

## Does it generalize beyond amphibians? Across eight taxa (36 → 518 species)

The experiment was repeated on richer Canada-wide taxa (DINOv2, iNat research-grade, project-free bbox):

- **Metric lever flips.** `haversine − raw` is *negative* for amphibians (raw wins) but mostly *positive* for the
  other taxa (great-circle wins). Longitude-overweighting is amphibian-specific, not a law.
- **Embedding benefit rises with richness** (ρ = +0.79). `bestEmb − bestSpatial` climbs from negative at low
  richness to very large at high richness — **except Arachnida (160 spp), strongly negative**. The "it's gated by
  embedding quality" guess is tested and refuted in the separability cell below.
- **Combined wins for 7 of 8 taxa.** `combined − bestSpatial` is positive everywhere except Arachnida.""")

md(r"""## Mechanism: does the embedding help when it out-separates geography?

Beyond "more species ⇒ more benefit", a sharper, *actionable* question: should you trust the embedding for a taxon?
We measured two **1-NN leave-one-out species separabilities** on the same data — one in DINOv2 embedding space
(cosine), one in geographic space (haversine) — and compared their **gap** to the observed benefit. The intuition:
the embedding earns its keep only when it separates species *better than location already does*.

- The **emb−geo separability gap** is an interpretable correlate of the benefit (ρ ≈ +0.69), and **geo_sep alone is
  negative** (ρ ≈ −0.52): when geography already tells species apart, the embedding is redundant.
- But it is **confounded with richness** (still the strongest single predictor, ρ ≈ +0.79) and does **not** add a
  clean independent signal.
- It does **not** rescue the **Arachnida** anomaly *within generic embeddings*: spiders have a normal positive
  emb−geo gap yet a negative DINOv2 benefit, so two separability-based mechanisms (embedding-quality,
  geography-out-separates) were tested and **refuted** here. The anomaly is instead resolved one section up by the
  **BioCLIP** run (+19.78): it was domain-mismatch — which a *generic*-embedding separability cannot measure. The
  refuted separability story is kept, not hidden, because it's what pointed to the domain-match explanation.

**Capstone:** BioCLIP raises 1-NN species separability for *every* taxon, and **most for exactly the arthropod taxa
generic embeddings failed** — Arachnida +0.168 (0.453→0.622), Insecta +0.237. That is the mechanism behind the
Arachnida rescue: domain-match raises separability where the generic backbone was deficient. (Cross-taxon, raw
separability still doesn't linearly predict the benefit — separability falls as richness rises while benefit rises,
so the benefit *magnitude* is richness-driven, the *sign/rescue* is domain-match.)""")

re-running it locally from the cluster's cached embeddings gave byte-identical `species@budget` to the mila V100 run.
**Independent embeddings, second cluster:** the amphibian experiment was re-run on **DRAC's fir cluster** (CPU,
torch 2.12, its own image-embedding pass), independent of the mila V100 run. The verdict reproduces — `combined`
beats the best spatial baseline and raw lat/lon beats great-circle on both clusters, with `species@budget` agreeing
to within ~0.5 species (the residual is a different iNat snapshot + GPU-vs-CPU numerics). The table below shows
`species@budget` per backbone per cluster; the headlines are each run's self-recorded verdict, read from JSON.""")

_Provenance & honesty. Every number above is read from the per-cluster result JSON the experiment wrote — none is
typed into this notebook. Two integrity controls make the verdict hard to dismiss: (1) the geographic baseline is
tested under **both** great-circle and raw-lat/lon distance, so "coverage wins" can't ride a lucky metric; (2) the
embedding arm is tested with both the standard outlier-prone k-center (CoreSet) and a robust D²-weighted variant,
so it can't be dismissed as a strawman. The verdict is a paired test (sign-flip permutation + bootstrap CI), not an
eyeballed gap. The robustness axis is the embedding **backbone** (Rauch: embedding quality drives the result),
tested across DINOv2 → CLIP → ResNet50._""")
